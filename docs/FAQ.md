# FAQ

### What is this?

Connective DX’s front-end toolset.

### What technologies are used?

[Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) is used as a general task runner.  Web assets (html, js, css, images, svgs) are built with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io).  [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) is used to rendering static html for CMS integration and render for browsers, using [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to transpile ES6 to ES5.  [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) is used to unit-test React components.  [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) is used to transform CSS, with [CSSNext](http://cssnext.io) as a base set of plugins.  [SVG Symbols](https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons) are used to easily define and use vector icons.

### Is it any good?

It depends.  It's a great tool for the way we build projects at [Connective DX](https://www.connectivedx.com), but may not align with your project's goals.  It is more focused on integrating with a back end system than application development.

### Where’s the documentation?

It's a slow and steady trek to writing great documentation. We are doing our best, but we'd love your suggestions. If you'd like to help improve these documents, just create a new branch and submit a Pull Request – it's why we're on github! :computer: :bamboo:

### Why fuzzy chainsaw?

GitHub gifted it to us as the randomly generated suggestion and we took it, because it’s a pretty awesome phrase.

### What verisons of Node are supported?

Fuzzy Chainsaw was developed to work best with Node's [most recent LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and above. We intend to keep support pegged to Node's [LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-schedule).
